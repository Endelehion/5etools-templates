				"The Moon Blades are clerics that sworn their blades to protect the innocent, no matter who they are or where they hail from,",
				" to fight against tyranny and to defend freedom at all costs.",

				" they fought courageously to liberate the shadow elves from the tyranny of Solavon and his followers who deemed them tainted servants of chaos,",
				" deserving of either lifetime in imprisonment or death. Such tyranny was standing against everything that the Moon Blades stood for.",
				" Thus they joined the Great Rebellion of the Shadow Elves, and after a great many battles the Shadow Elves of Arkan were finally free.",
				"Eons passed and again their sacred duty called, and they joined yet again in another great war, of which the annals of history would later call Cryselthaar's Rise,",
				" where several races of Cryselthaar united against the forces of the Vaerings whose only goal was the enslavement of all living things in Sunelreith, the Sunless Lands.",
				"The Moon Blades' power comes from their faith to Seleinawen, but a select few of the most renown warriors within the order have once claimed that the source",
				" behind the Moon Blades' powers comes from another being, far more powerful than Seleinawen. As expected, such claims were highly controversial within the order",
				" and in the end they were dismissed altogether by the higher echelons, but rumours say that to this day there are those who although respect and love Seleinawen",
				" for all she's done, they still believe in the existence of another, mysterious yet immensely powerful being that secretely guides them all throughout their lives.",
				"The Moon Blade's highest ideal is the freedom of the individual, and they've proven through the ages that they are not afraid to wield their blades to confront tyranny wherever they may find it.",
